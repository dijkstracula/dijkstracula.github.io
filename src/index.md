## About me

<img src="/assets/me.jpg" alt="Nathan Taylor" class="headshot">

I'm a staff software engineer at [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/), where I work
on static analysis for code security.  Prior to joining Semgrep, I was a PhD
student at UT Austin, where I worked on applying formal methods to concurrent
and distributed systems.  In the distant past, I was lucky enough to live in
beautiful [Oakland, CA](https://localwiki.org/oakland/), where I scaled
low-level systems and infrastructure at some companies you've heard of. Outside
of industry, I was a contract developer at [Microsoft
Research](https://web.archive.org/web/20250320000332/https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/ai-for-systems/)
and a computer science instructor at [Macewan
University](https://www.macewan.ca/academics/academic-departments/computer-science/)
and the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/).

I hold a M.Sc. from the [University of British Columbia](http://cs.ubc.ca/) in
rainy [Vancouver,
BC](https://weather.eos.ubc.ca/wxfcst/current/cameras/index.html), where [Andy
Warfield](https://cs.ubc.ca/~andy/) and I hacked on hypervisor-level dynamic
analysis tools. I also hold a B.Sc. from the University of Alberta in chilly
[Edmonton,
AB](https://www.ualberta.ca/earth-sciences/facilities/edmonton-river-valley.html).
